# Introduction

### Summary
I'm very appreciate for this coding test.
Wish you all the best.

### Before start project
1. please set `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` to VM-Opt to make sure use the same encoding
2. please set value of `requestNum` in file ```com.hsbc.test.admin.BaiDuRequestService``` as `N` request to baidu.com [default: 100]
3. please set value of `SAVE_FILE_PATH` in file ```com.hsbc.test.admin.BaiDuRequestService``` as the save path in your PC

### After start
1. please find the explore `.html` file from `SAVE_FILE_PATH` you set
2. please NOTE that since the `N` could be a huge number, for security reason, so some html file will explore like <a>Found</a>, please click the link and get the result page
